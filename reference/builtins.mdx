This list reflects what’s currently implemented (alpha). If something here behaves differently, file an issue.

## Testing

- `assert(condition[, message])`
- `assert_eq(a, b)`

## Lists

- `first(list)`
- `last(list)`
- `count(list)`

## Math / ranges

- `sum(range_or_list)`

(Additional built-ins will be documented here as they stabilize.)
