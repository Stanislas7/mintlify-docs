# Overview

A Tide program is made of:

- `relation` declarations (named rules)
- optional `let` bindings
- `query` statements

Tide is designed to read like a small, clean scripting language, while keeping the “relations + queries” mental model.

If you want a fast tour, run:

```bash
./bin/tide examples/basics.tide
```
