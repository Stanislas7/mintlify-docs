title: Queries & output
---

A Tide program is usually a mix of `relation` definitions and `query` statements.

## `query` is how you "print"

Tide is currently side-effect-light: there isn’t a general-purpose `print(...)` builtin.

Instead, you use `query` to evaluate an expression and display its result:

```tide
query 1 + 2
query "hello"
query [x * x for x in 1..5]
```

In the REPL, each `query` shows you the computed value.

## Why this is nice

- keeps programs readable
- avoids IO semantics in the early alpha
- makes examples and docs consistent

A real `print` (or logging) can come later once the semantics are nailed down.
