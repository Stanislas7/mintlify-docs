title: Why relations?
---

Tide uses `relation` declarations as its core abstraction.

## Why not "functions"?

A normal function story quickly pulls in a lot of machinery:

- return values vs side effects
- purity vs IO
- modules/imports
- a growing standard library

Tide starts with something simpler: **rules**.

A relation reads like a set of clauses:

```tide
relation abs where
  abs(x) = x  when x >= 0
  abs(x) = -x when x < 0
```

This gives you:

- pattern matching by default
- clear top-to-bottom selection (first match wins)
- a natural way to express multiple cases

You can *use* relations like functions:

```tide
query abs(-5) // 5
```

In other words: Tide doesn’t hate functions — it just picks a cleaner default.
