title: Relations
---
Relations define named rules.

```tide
relation double where
  double(x) = x * 2

query double(5) // 10
```

## Multiple clauses

Clauses are tried top-to-bottom. The first matching clause wins.

```tide
relation abs where
  abs(x) = x  when x >= 0
  abs(x) = -x when x < 0
```

## Guards (`when`)

A clause can have an optional boolean guard:

```tide
relation factorial where
  factorial(0) = 1
  factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1) when n > 0
```
