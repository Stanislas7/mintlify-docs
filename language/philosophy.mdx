Tide is trying to be the kind of language you *want* to read.

## The vibe

- **Small surface area**: fewer features, better composability.
- **Predictable semantics**: if it surprises you, it’s probably a bug.
- **REPL-first**: you should be able to explore ideas in seconds.
- **Data + rules**: Tide leans toward describing relationships, not wiring up plumbing.

## What Tide is (today)

- A tiny interpreter with a single executable
- A clean syntax for rules (`relation`) + results (`query`)
- Practical constructs: ranges, lists, dicts, comprehensions, conditionals

## What Tide is *not* (yet)

- A stable spec (alpha means we’re still shaping it)
- A big standard library
- A production toolchain (packaging, debugger, LSP)

If you like the direction, the best contribution is: **tight feedback** on semantics + ergonomics.
