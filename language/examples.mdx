A few Tide snippets that show the vibe.

## Factorial with guards

```tide
relation factorial where
  factorial(0) = 1
  factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1) when n > 0

query factorial(6)
```

## Comprehensions + ranges

```tide
query [x * x for x in 1..10]
query [x for x in 1..30 when x % 2 == 0]
```

## Dicts feel like data

```tide
let person = {name: "Alice", age: 30}
query person.name
```

## Tiny tests (assertions)

```tide
relation double where
  double(x) = x * 2

assert_eq(double(5), 10)
```
