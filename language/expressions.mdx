Tide supports common expression forms:

- arithmetic: `+ - * / %`
- comparisons: `== != < <= > >=`
- boolean operators (as implemented)
- conditionals: `if <cond> then <a> else <b>`

Example:

```tide
query if 5 > 3 then "yes" else "no"
```

Note: Tide is alpha; the exact precedence/associativity rules are documented in the [Grammar](../reference/grammar).
