title: Tide
---
Tide is an experimental programming language with a tiny surface area, a REPL-first workflow, and a focus on **clean syntax**.

What’s in the box today:

- A single binary (`tide`) you can build with `make`
- `relation` definitions with pattern matching + `when` guards
- `query` statements, ranges, list comprehensions, lists, dicts
- A small but growing standard library (built-ins)

## Start here

- [Quickstart](quickstart)
- [Language overview](language/overview)
- [CLI reference](reference/cli)

## Project status

Tide is **alpha**. Expect sharp edges, but also fast iteration.

If something feels inconsistent, that’s a bug (or a missing spec) — please open an issue.
