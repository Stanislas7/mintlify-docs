# Quickstart

## Build

Requirements:

- `make`
- `clang` (or `gcc`)

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y make clang build-essential
```

Clone the language repo and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stanislas7/tide
cd tide
make
```

## Run the REPL

```bash
./bin/tide
```

## Run a file

```bash
./bin/tide examples/basics.tide
```

## Run tests

```bash
./bin/tide --test
```

Tide’s test runner executes all `*.tide` files in `./tests` and fails on the first failing assertion.
