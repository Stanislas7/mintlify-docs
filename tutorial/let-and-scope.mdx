title: let bindings and scope
---

`let` is Tide’s way to name a value.

You can think of it as “pin this value to a name so I can use it later.”

## Basic bindings

```tide
let answer = 42
query answer
query answer + 1
```

## Bindings are just values

You can bind any expression:

```tide
let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let squares = [x * x for x in xs]

query squares
```

Or bind a dictionary (record-like value):

```tide
let person = {name: "Alice", age: 30}
query person.name
```

## Scope (what can “see” what?)

Tide currently has a simple model:

- `let` bindings at the top level are available to later code in the same file.
- Comprehension variables (like `x` in `[... for x in ...]`) are local to that comprehension.

Example:

```tide
let xs = [1, 2, 3]
query [x + 1 for x in xs]

// `x` is not available here.
// query x
```

## A practical tip

When exploring the language, it’s totally normal to write:

- a few `let`s
- then a bunch of `query`s

That style makes Tide feel like a programmable notebook.
