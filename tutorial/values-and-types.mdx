title: Values and types
---

Tide is small on purpose: you can learn the whole *shape* of the language quickly, then start writing relations.

This page covers the everyday runtime values Tide understands today (alpha).

## Numbers

Tide supports integers and floats.

```tide
query 40 + 2
query 10 * (3 + 4)
query 7 % 3
query 3.14 * 2
```

## Booleans

Booleans show up mostly in comparisons and conditionals.

```tide
query 5 > 3
query 2 == 3
```

## Strings

Strings use double quotes.

```tide
query "tide"
```

## Lists

Lists are written with square brackets.

```tide
query [1, 2, 3]
query ["a", "b", "c"]
```

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are written `{key: value, ...}`:

```tide
query {name: "Alice", age: 30}
```

You’ll see lists most often with comprehensions:

```tide
query [x * x for x in 1..5]
```

## Ranges

A range is written `a..b` (inclusive) or `a..<b` (exclusive).

```tide
query 1..5
query 1..<5
```

Ranges are especially useful as iterables in comprehensions.

## A note on “types” in Tide

Tide is intentionally lightweight:

- You don’t write type annotations.
- You learn the language by *running queries*.

When in doubt, put something behind a `query` and see what it evaluates to.
