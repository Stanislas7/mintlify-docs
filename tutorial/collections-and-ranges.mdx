title: Collections and ranges
---

Most Tide programs end up moving little collections of values around.

## Lists

Create a list with `[...]`:

```tide
let xs = [1, 2, 3]
query xs
```

Lists play nicely with comprehensions:

```tide
let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
query [x * 10 for x in xs]
```

Built-ins like `first`, `last`, and `count` work on lists:

```tide
query first([10, 20, 30])
query last([10, 20, 30])
query count([10, 20, 30])
```

## Dictionaries (records)

Dictionaries look like `{key: value, ...}` and are great for named data.

```tide
let person = {name: "Alice", age: 30}
query person.name
query person.age
```

## Ranges

Ranges are written `a..b` and are typically used as iterables.

```tide
query 1..5     // inclusive end
query 1..<5    // exclusive end
```

A classic Tide moment is: “make a range, then build a list from it”:

```tide
query [x * x for x in 1..10]
```

And if you just want a number out, use `sum`:

```tide
query sum(1..100)
```

## One mental model

- Lists are *data you already have*.
- Ranges are *data you can generate*.

Comprehensions are the bridge between them.
