title: Expressions, operators, and precedence
---

Tide expressions are meant to feel familiar if you’ve used C/JS/Python.

## Arithmetic

```tide
query 1 + 2 * 3      // multiplication binds tighter
query (1 + 2) * 3    // parentheses win
query 10 / 2
query 10 % 3
```

## Comparisons

Comparisons return booleans:

```tide
query 5 > 3
query 5 >= 5
query 2 != 3
query 2 == 2
```

## Equality vs “same result”

When you’re testing, prefer the built-ins:

```tide
query assert_eq(2 + 2, 4)
```

## Precedence rules (keep it simple)

Tide is still alpha, and the grammar is still stabilizing.

Rules of thumb that will keep you out of trouble:

- Use parentheses when mixing operators.
- Assume `* / %` bind tighter than `+ -`.
- Comparisons (`< <= > >= == !=`) bind looser than arithmetic.

If you want the current parser rules, see the draft [Grammar](../reference/grammar).

## Debugging trick: query sub-expressions

If a big expression surprises you, break it apart:

```tide
query 1 + 2 * 3
query 2 * 3
query 1 + 6
```

Tide is designed to make that “poke and observe” workflow pleasant.
