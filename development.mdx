## Repo layout (language)

The Tide language implementation lives in:

- https://github.com/Stanislas7/tide

Typical structure:

- `src/` — implementation (lexer/parser/eval)
- `examples/` — example programs
- `tests/` — assertion-based test programs

## Build

```bash
make clean && make
```

## Run tests

```bash
./bin/tide --test
```

## CI

The language repo includes GitHub Actions that:

- builds on clang and gcc
- runs tests
- runs a sanitizer build (ASan/UBSan) to catch memory bugs early

## Docs

These docs are a separate repo:

- https://github.com/Stanislas7/tide-docs

They’re built with Mintlify. Edit `.mdx` files and `docs.json` to update navigation.
